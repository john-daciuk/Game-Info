### Game Info

**Game Rules:**

The game is simple: *connect four in any direction to win*.

**Some advise:**

If you can build an open ended connect three before your opponent does, you should win because your opponent cannot block both ends.  Now, an open ended three is built out of an open ended two!  Work to set up your stones so that you can simultaneously align open ended two's and give yourself more avenues to win than your opponent can block.

**App mechanics:**

Loser moves first on new game start.
